Swap linked list for the array of asteroids 

linklists contain pointer to node and pointer to data

Universe structure:
Hold two linklists:(1) asteroids currently in the simulation (2) newly created asteroids that needed to beb added to the belt
What structure has: data & node 
data is void pointer which can point to the structure of asteroids

All linked list functions will be in linkedlist.c:
We have three external functions: traverse, insert and deletesoem 
Internal functions: allocateNode and freeNode
insert succsess return, fail return (allocate fails)

The work = list holding asteroids belt, traverse operation and action operation

asteroid belt list: hold asteroid in simulation, in increasing order

Hoding area for newly created asteroids: when fission appears, add ast to hoding area

add ast in hold to belt

we draw ast in traverse function

three files: input output diagnostics
