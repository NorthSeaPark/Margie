Keep programming every day.
Make programming as a habit.

Typedef:
typedef struct Books {
   char title[50];
   char author[50];
   char subject[100];
   int book_id;
} Book;


Insert node in order
|-----|     |-----|
|--2--|---->|--4--|
|-----|     |-----|
This is the basic situation
Case 1:
*if the next node of head is NULL or the the value of head is larger than the insert value
Then, we adjust
Case 2:
*if the next node of head is not NULL and the insert value is larger than the head
Then,
We loop the list_nodes until we find the nodes which is larger than the insert value (or we just directly go to the end)
